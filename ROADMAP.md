# kdx Development Roadmap

## Overview

This document outlines the planned development phases for kdx, addressing identified architectural gaps and feature requirements. The roadmap is organized into sequential phases with clear technical objectives and success criteria.

## Current State (Post Phase 1)

kdx currently provides:
- **Comprehensive Resource Discovery**: 13 resource types (services, pods, deployments, statefulsets, daemonsets, configmaps, secrets, crds, custom-resources)
- **Advanced Filtering**: Complex label selectors, status filtering, resource grouping
- **Service Analysis**: Topology analysis, dependency graphs, service relationships
- **Configuration Management**: ConfigMap/Secret usage tracking with security-conscious design
- **Custom Resource Support**: CRD discovery and custom resource instance analysis
- **Multiple Output Formats**: Table, JSON, YAML with consistent formatting
- **Production Ready**: Full CI/CD pipeline, automated testing, Homebrew distribution

## Identified Gaps

Based on user feedback and technical analysis, the following areas require enhancement:

1. Limited resource type coverage
2. Scalability constraints for large clusters
3. Lack of RBAC and permission awareness
4. Static topology snapshots only
5. Basic visualization capabilities
6. Minimal filtering and query granularity
7. No observability integration
8. Limited configuration and extensibility
9. Single-cluster scope limitations
10. Non-interactive CLI experience
